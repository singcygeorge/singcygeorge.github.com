## Singcy George

Hi, my name is Singcy George. I have a Master's Degree in Environmental Science from the University of Northampton. I'm married to a lovely husband and moved to the US where I now work for a bank as a teller.

Aside from Environmental Science some of my other interests include photography, movies, and working out.

I started this blog so I can explore my thoughts and share some of my ideas and interests. I hope you enjoy reading my blog.
